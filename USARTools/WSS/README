This is the new Wireless Simulation Server (WSS) developed by Max Pfingsthorn.

You need Trolltech's Qt Windowing Toolkit Version 4.3.4 or later to compile.

Simply run

	qmake
	
to generate a Makefile or build project for your platform. On Mac, it might be useful
to use the macx-g++ build system if you don't use XCode much.

	qmake -spec macx-g++
	
If you want to generate a Visual C++ Project, use

	qmake -t vcapp
	
This also works for the latest Visual C++ Express Edition (2008 at the time of this writing).

Build the application with your compiler. In Windows, use nmake for command line builds.
