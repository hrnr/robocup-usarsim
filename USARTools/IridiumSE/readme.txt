Iridium Script Engine

This project allows scripting of USAR commands using Ruby. As this project did not get a lot of development time,
documentation is unfortunately somewhat sparse. A good starting point might be to read the .rb files inside the
src/ folder (these files are packages from within the JAR file). API for communicating with USAR is found there.
It is reasonably complete but not comprehensive. If a feature is missing, use Ruby's features and complete it at
runtime!

An example script to grab Kinect data can be found in 'kinect.rb'.
